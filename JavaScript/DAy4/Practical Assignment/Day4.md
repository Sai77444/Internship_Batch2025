# JavaScript Array Methods: forEach, map, and filter

In JavaScript, arrays come with several powerful methods to iterate and manipulate data. Three commonly used methods are `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`.

The `forEach` method is used to execute a given function once for each element in the array. For example, consider an array of user objects, each having a `firstName` and `age`. Using `forEach`, we can loop through each user and print their `firstName`. This method is useful when we want to perform an action (like logging or updating values) without returning a new array.

The `map` method is used when we want to transform each element of an array and get a new array in return. In the same user example, we can use `map` to extract only the `firstName` from each object and return a new array of just names. This is helpful when you want to create a derived array based on the original one without modifying the original data.

The `filter` method is useful when we want to filter out certain elements based on a condition. For instance, given an array of numbers, we can use `filter` along with a function (like checking if a number is even) to get a new array that includes only even numbers. This method returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the provided condition.

Together, these three methods — `forEach`, `map`, and `filter` — provide flexible and efficient ways to work with arrays in JavaScript.
