What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language used mainly for web development.

It allows you to make web pages interactive (for example: buttons that do something when clicked, forms that validate input, image sliders, animations, etc.).

It works on the browser as well as on the server (using Node.js).

History of JavaScript
1995 – Creation

Brendan Eich created JavaScript in just 10 days while working at Netscape.

It was meant to be a simple scripting language that runs in the browser.

1996 – Microsoft Adopts It

Microsoft created its own version called JScript for Internet Explorer.

This led to differences in how browsers ran scripts.

1997 – Standardization

To solve these differences, JavaScript was standardized by ECMA International.

The standard is called ECMAScript (ES).

JavaScript is the most common implementation of ECMAScript.

2000s – Growth

As browsers improved, JavaScript got new features.

Libraries like jQuery made it easier to use.

2009 – Node.js

JavaScript was brought to the server-side with Node.js.

This allowed developers to use one language for both frontend and backend.

2015 – Modern JavaScript (ES6)

A major update called ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) introduced features like let, const, arrow functions, classes, promises, etc.

Since then, JavaScript has become very powerful and modern
